    "It's been said that to understand recursion you must understand recursion. In programming terms, a recursion function is one where the function will call itself inside of it's function definition. Its value in practice depends on the programming language and use case. It can result in a very compact piece of code or it can result in infinite loop that never terminates if not used carefully.\n",
